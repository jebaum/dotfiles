# `scpur`
#
# this script uses scp to transfer a file to a web accessable directory
# on a remote machine. options specified here are used directly with
# `scp`.
#
# if on your remote server, the directory `/srv/http/files/` corresponds
# to the web address <http://server/files/>, then set the following
# options to correspond to any scp command you would use to copy files
# to `/srv/http/files/`. eg:
#
#    scp -P 42222 dog.jpg user@server:/srv/http/files/
#
# making `dog.jpg` accessible at <http://server/files/dog.jpg>, then your
# options would be set as follows:

SCPOPTS="-P 22"
SSHSTR="james@jbaumy.com"
SSHDIR="/home/james/Dropbox/jbaumy.com/files/"
WEBURL="http://files.jbaumy.com/"

# OPTIONAL - put files with certain extensions into distinct directories
# For each extension you should have 3 consecutive entries:
# The extension, the path on the server to put the file, and the weburl where that path is found
# If configured, must be in valid bash array format, as shown below:
# If not configured or when dealing with an extension not specified here,
# the above settings will be used

EXTENSIONS=( \
'txt' '/home/james/Dropbox/jbaumy.com/files/text' 'http://jbaumy.com/files/text' \
'jpg' '/home/james/Dropbox/jbaumy.com/files/screens' 'http://jbaumy.com/files/screens' \
