the python files in here are copies of the files installed by the AUR rofication-git package
which I assume are just whatever is here: https://github.com/DaveDavenport/Rofication
since the above repo hasn't seen any updates in years (seems feature complete)

on arch, the gui file is installed at /usr/bin/rofication-gui.py by default
on regolith (my laptop), it is at /usr/bin/rofication-gui, no .py extension

i tweaked the additional_args list passed to rofi from the default gui file and copied
it along with msg.py directly into /usr/local/bin, was the simplest way to get it working how i wanted
(without copying msg.py into same directory, the `import msg` stuff in rofication-gui.py fails)
