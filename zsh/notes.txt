I use zim, and modify zshrc and zimrc

as far as zim is concerned, zshrc only exists to source the zim init.zsh file
(init.zsh then also sources ~/.zimrc)

I keep them in my dotfiles repo and change the zim install to symlink to them
instead of to the ones in ~/.zim.

if zim/templates/{zshrc,zimrc} get updated upstream, I'll have to edit the changes in manually

1. zimrc
    enable modules, setup syntax highlighting.
    optionally choose prompt, muck with completion
2. zshrc
    my specific config - other files to source, bindkeys, overriding anything from zim, etc
