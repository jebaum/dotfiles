I use prezto, and modify zshrc and zpreztorc

as far as prezto is concerned, zshrc pretty much only exists to source the prezto config
as of March 17 2016, it hasn't been updated in 2 years, and probably won't be. doesn't do much

zpreztorc is updated from time to time, but not very often

I keep them in my dotfiles repo and change the prezto install to symlink to them instead
of to the ones in ~/.zprezto. That way, prezto updates can be done with
    `git pull && git submodule update --init --recursive`
All of my config changes remain in my dotfiles repo, and I don't have to maintain a fork of prezto.

if prezto/runcoms/{zshrc,zpreztorc} get updated upstream, I'll have to edit the changes in manually

the prezto zshrc template sources prezto/init.zsh, which sources zpreztorc
the customized section of zshrc is all sourced after init.zsh and zpreztorc

1. zpreztorc
    enable modules and set editor mode
2. zshrc
    my specific config - other files to source, bindkeys, overriding anything from prezto, etc
